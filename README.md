## Introduction

* School dropout rate, as the name suggests, is the percentage or rate of students failing to complete a particular schooL due to various reasons. 
* Our Dataset consists of students dropping out globally, in their upper secondary i.e. 9th-12th standards. 
* We have analyzed 106 countries which have been segragted in 3 groups based on their development:
   - Least Developed (41) 
   - Less developed  (57)
   - More Developed  (8)
